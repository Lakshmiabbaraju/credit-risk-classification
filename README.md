# credit-risk-classification

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to predict the credit risk of loans, specifically classifying them as either healthy or high-risk, using historical lending data. We used logistic regression for classification.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: 99%
- **Precision (Healthy loans)**: 100%
- **Recall (Healthy loans)**: 99%
- **Precision (High-risk loans)**: 85%
- **Recall (High-risk loans)**: 91%

## Summary
The logistic regression model performs well overall, with high accuracy and strong performance for healthy loans. However, there is room for improvement in predicting high-risk loans due to class imbalance. We recommend exploring techniques to handle this imbalance or trying other models for better prediction of high-risk loans.
